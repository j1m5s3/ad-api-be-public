/**
 * @title DutchAuction
 * @author Doug Crescenzi, Kseniya Lifanova - team@upstate.agency
 * @notice DutchAuction is a contract for managing the dutch auction of a non-fungible token (NFT).
 * The contract owner, or beneficiary, sets their high asking price and their low,
 * reserve price for the NFT they are auctioning off. Additionally, the beneficiary sets the
 * length of time for which they'd like their auction to run.
 *
 * To start the auction the beneficiary calls the startAuction function and passes it the
 * token's contract as well as the tokenId of the NFT they are auctioning.
 * The asking price for the NFT decreases every day at a rate that is proportional
 * to the total amount of time between the high asking price and the low, reserve price.
 * E.g., (highAskingPrice - lowAskingPrice) / auctionLength = descendingPriceRate
 *
 * The first bidder to bid on the NFT's currentAskingPrice is awarded the NFT.
 *
 * This has also been called a clock auction or open-outcry descending-price auction.
 * This type of auction is good for auctioning goods quickly,
 * since a sale never requires more than one bid.
